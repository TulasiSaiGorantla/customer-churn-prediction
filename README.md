# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn using machine learning models on the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle.

## 📋 Project Overview
Customer churn is when a customer stops using a service or product. Predicting churn is critical for companies to retain customers.
This project uses Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to:
- Preprocess customer data
- Train machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance

## 🔍 Dataset
- Source: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- CSV file: `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
- Contains customer demographics, subscription information, and churn status (Yes/No).

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
